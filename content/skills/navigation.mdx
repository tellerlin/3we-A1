   - Keep the map oriented as you move

2. **Taking Bearings**
   - How to take a bearing from the map
   - Following a bearing in the field
   - Back bearings and triangulation

## Modern Navigation Tools

While traditional navigation skills are essential, modern tools can enhance your navigation capabilities:

- GPS devices
- Smartphone apps
- Satellite communicators

Remember: Always carry a physical map and compass as backup!

## Practice Makes Perfect
